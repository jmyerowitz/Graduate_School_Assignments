## R Webscraping and RShiny

This is the culmination of two differenct projects: A webscraping project using Rvest from October 2019 and an RShiny App based on the data that was webscraped from November 2019.

If you would like to check out the live version of the RShiny App, please feel free to click [here](https://jordanmyerowitz.shinyapps.io/RShinyAllTrails/) and find new trails in Maine and New Hampshire!

### Files:
