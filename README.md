A repository for a collection of graduate school assignments.

*Lending Club*: This assignment from August of 2019 analyzed Lending Club data from 2012-2017, with a specific focus on years 2012- 2014 and 2015 – 2017 (before and after Lending Club’s IPO).

*NH Traffic Hackathon*: First "major" assignment in R, from June 2019. Exploratory Data Analysis using New Hampshire Traffic Stop Data.

*R_Webscraping_and_RShiny*: The culmination of two separate projects in October and November 2019. Using the package Rvest in R, I web-scraped hiking trail data in New Hampshire and Maine. I also conducted machine learning on hiking trails by first programming Principle Component Analysis then K-Means clustering in Python Then, using the R packages shiny, shinythemes, plotly, ggplot2, and leaflet, designed an RShiny app to explore hiking clusters and their characteristics in order to find new trails.
