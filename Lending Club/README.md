## Lending Club Analysis

This assignment from August of 2019 analyzed Lending Club data from 2012-2017, with a specific focus on years 2012- 2014 and 2015 – 2017 (before and after Lending Club’s IPO). 

Using NumPy and Pandas, I reduced dimensions by way of PCA on the dataset in order to employ K-Means clustering on loan profiles before and after Lending Club’s IPO. Some insights included increased number of loans after the IPO, along with more unrestricted loan authorizations. 

Seeing as this was the first "major" assignment using Python coding, please forgive me if it seems amateurish and rough in places.
